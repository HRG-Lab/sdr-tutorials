# About sdr-tutorials
This repository contains tutorials and getting-started instructions for using a Software-Defined Radio (SDR). The purpose is to have a centralized location where new users can get their setup together and interface with an SDR to study digital communications. This will be updated as new versions and releases come out, as well as new architectures are implemented.

You should clone this repository to download a copy of all of the example flowgraphs and a local copy of the out-of-tree (OOT) modules from HRG.

## GNURadio Installation Instructions
First, we will need to get an instance of Ubuntu or Raspbian Linux working. This section will detail several setups depending on if you have native Ubuntu, native Windows, or an embedded device such as a Raspberry Pi.

### Pybombs Overview

### Native Ubuntu LTS (20.04)
This is the easiest way to get GNURadio up and running.

### Ubuntu LTS (20.04) over Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2
This is a nice way to use a virtualized Linux kernel setup on Windows without needing to do a full OS install.

### Raspberry Pi OS


## Guided Tutorials for HRG-Lab
Now that GNURadio is installed, we can use GNURadio to set up some basic examples. Descriptions of each tutorial are below, and the instructions are inside each specific sub-directory of this repository.

### (Beginner) FM Transmitter Simulation

### (Beginner) Interfacing with Hardware (PlutoSDR)

### (Intermediate) Installing an OOT Module

### Adding a Block with `gr_modtool`, the Swiss-Army Knife of GNURadio
